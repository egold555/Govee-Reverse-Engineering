## A Message to Govee

>In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [(17 USC ยง 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).
>
>It is also often lawful to reverse-engineer an artifact or process as long as it is obtained legitimately. If the software is patented, it doesn't necessarily need to be reverse-engineered, as patents require a public disclosure of invention. It should be mentioned that, just because a piece of software is patented, that does not mean the entire thing is patented; there may be parts that remain undisclosed.


Govee we love your products! I initally decided to publish my findings, and protocol reverse engineering so that anyone else who is looking to do the same might have a place to start. As hackers, we wanted to add more functionality to your devices, and controll them not just from the app.

TL;DR, __please don't sue me, any contributors, or DMCA this repo__. If you wish for me to take it down, __please email me or leave a issue on this repo stating that you would like it to be removed, and I will happily do so__.

With all that out of the way, on to the documentation!

## Contributing
Please feel free to make pull requests or issues with new products, or updated documentation for existing products. I want to exmand this repo to as many products to serve as a hub for reverse enginering Govee's products.
