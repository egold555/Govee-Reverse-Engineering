I have only tested this on the Govee H6127 so I am unsure if these packets or UUID's work for anything else.
Log is found by enabling developer options bluetooth_hci snoop log `adb bugreport anewbugreport && unzip anewbugreport.zip && wireshark FS/data/log/bt/btsnoop_hci.log`
To filter the ATT packets, 
### Checklist of packets
- [x] Keep alive
- [x] Change Color
- [x] Change Color of each of 15 segments
- [x] Gradient
- [x] Set global brightness
- [x] Change to music mode
- [x] Change music mode to cycle colors
- [X] Change Scenes(update)
- [x] DIY Mode

### How packets work
From my understanding, all packets are 20 bytes long. 
The first byte is a identifier, followed by 18 bytes of data, followed by an XOR of ALL the bytes.
0x33 seems to be a command indicator (the only alternatives value for the first byte is 0xaa, 0xa1)
    
    0x33: Indicator
    0xaa: keep alive
    0xa1: DIY VALUES

The second byte seems identify the packet type

    0x01: Power
    0x04: Brightness
    0x05: Color

The third byte differs based on type.

    For power packets, it's a boolean indicating the power state. (0x00, or 0x01)
    For brightness packets, it corresponds to a uint8 brightness value, affecting lights at about 0x14 to 1% - 0xfe to 100%
    For color packets, this indicates an operation mode.
    
    0x33: Indicator
        0x01: Power
            0x00: Off
            0x01: On
        0x04: Brightness
            0x00: 0% (also Off)
            0x14: 1%
            0xfe: 100%
        0x05: Color
            0x02: Manual
            0x01: Music
            0x04: Scene
            0x0a: DIY


Color packets also carry an RGB value, followed by a boolean and a second RGB value. The boolean seems to switch the set of LEDs used within the bulb. 

```
Have not verified this in the H6127 but the condition appears to exist. (from h6113)
There is one set for RGB values and one for warm/cold-white values, where True corresponds to the warm/cold-white LEDs. When the flag is set, the first RGB value seems to be ignored and vice-versa. The values for warm/cold-white LEDs cannot be set arbitrarily. The slider within the app UI uses a list of hardcoded color codes. (thanks Henje!)
````

Zeropadding follows. unless colors can be changed within mode.
Finally, a checksum over the payload is calculated by XORing all bytes.

### DIY
DIY mode appears to start with a keep alive followed by a start data packet, followed by 1 to 3 packets of data, followed by an end data packet, followed by the DIY mode command.

#### DIY Mode Data
Start Packet consists of 0xa102, PACKET#(0x00), TOTAL PACKET#'S, PADDING, XOR
````
a102 00 02 000000000000000000000000000000a1 = Start
````
First 2 bytes are a1 and 02 sigaling a write
    
    0xa102: Write Data

Third byte is the Number of the packet from 00-ff
    
    0x00: Start
    0x01: Number of packet
    0x02: Number of packet
    0x03: Number of packet
    0xff: End

Fourth byte is the name of the DIY in the App

    3b: Name

Fifth and Sixth bytes are the Style and the Style Mode

    00:Fade               01:Jumping              02:Flicker             03:Marquee           04:Music           FF:combo
        00:Whole              00:whole                00:Whole               03:Straight          08:Rhythm          00:??
        01: N/A               01:subsection           01:subsection          04:Gathered          06:Spectrum
        02:Circulation        02:circulation          02:Circulation         05:Dispersive        07:Rolling

Seventh byte is the Speed of transitions 00 being no movement, and 64 appearing to be the fastest
    
    00: No movement
    64: Fastest movement

Eighth byte is unknown at this time:

    18: PADDING?
    
Remaining bytes are the Colors limited to 8 colors total between (2 packets) 
    
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFXX: Red, Green, XOR

Last byte is the XOR as shown above:

    XX: XOR

```
0xa102, PACKET#, NAME, STYLE, MODE, SPEED, ??, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, XOR
a102 01 0a 03 03 2b 18 ff0000 ff7f00 ffff00 00ff 1b
```

****The Second packet is mostly only color data and is only necessary if there are more than 2 colors in the DIY:****

First 2 bytes of 2nd Packet a102

    0xa102: Write Data
    
Third bytes of 2nd Packet is the packet number

    0x02: Packet number

Fourth byte of 2nd Packet is the Blue color data of the previous packet (if more than 2 colors)

    0xFF: Blue

Remaining packets are color packets, adding and XOR

    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0x000000XX: Padding and XOR

```
0xa102, PACKET#, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, XOR
a102 02 00 0000ff 00ffff 8b00ff ffffff 000000d5 = Data
```

****Third Packet Appears to be for Combo Style and Style mode data****
    
    a102 03 0100 0200 0303 00000000000000000000a3 

End Packet appears to be 0xa102, 0xff, Padding, XOR

```
a102 ff 000000000000000000000000000000005c = End
```

#### DIY Mode command
```
